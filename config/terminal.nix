  ### Terminal shells

  # Sets up the shells I use to have their configuration managed by
  # home manager.

  # Fish is my default shell. It mostly shine due to its great
  # completion mechanism.
  programs.fish.enable = true;

  # These days I use Bash mostly when I call `nix-shell`, which only
  # ever opens Bash.
  programs.bash = {
    enable = true;
    enableCompletion = true;

  };

  # I don't use much of Nushell, to be honest. But it's useful to have
  # it configured if I am to do a bit of data scraping from time to
  # time.
  #
  # Nushell is coming along quite nicely, honestly. Completion is
  # competitive with fish (Fish is still a little better, I'd say, for
  # instance it has the visual indicator for commands which don't
  # exist, the predictive completion is more powerful in Fish; overall
  # Fish feels smoother). Direnv works too. I could consider switching
  # to Nushell as my main shell.

  ### Theming

  # Starship is a terminal independent (well it supports a bunch of
  # terminals, not all of them, no eshell for instance, last time I
  # checked anyway, but that would be asking a lot) dynamic prompt
  # customisation. It is quite themable (my configuration is not
  # particularly vanilla), and can display a bunch of information such
  # as the programming environment that is set up, a summary of the
  # git status, ‚Ä¶

  ### Customisation

  # Enables and themes the fzf fuzzy finder. Most importantly for this
